<p>Our Bittle robot prototypes have now successfully completed over 500 hours of rigorous testing, validating all core functions and passing key development milestones.</p>

<h3>Mobility and Navigation</h3>

<p>Bittle demonstrated reliable mobility by fluidly navigating a simulated apartment environment with multiple rooms. Using LIDAR sensors and advanced path planning algorithms, Bittle capably mapped spaces and avoided obstacles.</p>

<h3>Speech and Conversation Abilities</h3>  

<p>During conversations with team members, Bittle showed accurate speech recognition and language understanding. Bittle gave contextually relevant and logically coherent responses to questions spanning over 300 unique conversation prompts.</p>

<h3>Object Manipulation</h3>

<p>Fine motor skills testing allowed Bittle to successfully pick up and handle common household items of varying sizes and shapes with precision gripper hands. Tests included objects like keys, phones, bottles, remotes, and articles of clothing.</p>

<p>With these major milestones met, we are proceeding with final refinements and preparations to begin manufacturing ahead of Bittle's consumer launch on June 30th. Stay tuned for more updates soon!</p>
