		<h1>Who got snubbed by the Oscars? Barbie, but not Ken.</h1>
		<h2>This Barbie is not a best actress nominee.</h2>
 		<p>Margot Robbie was snubbed for her titular role in “Barbie” when the 96th Academy Award nominees were announced Tuesday morning. “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig was also shut out of the best director category.
		The film scored eight nods total, including best picture and supporting actress (America Ferrera for her portrayal as Gloria). But many called out academy voters online, noting the irony that Ryan Gosling was nominated in the best supporting actor category (even though he's "just Ken")..</p>

		<p>Others lamented that Gerwig delivered Hollywood a huge box office win and still didn't get the academy's highest recognition.
		“Barbie” was one of the biggest films of 2023, breaking records by taking in over $1 billion at the box office. The film was part of the cultural phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer,” with thousands flocking to theaters dressed in pink or black to see back-to-back showings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” By comparison, Christopher Nolan's portrait of the father of the atomic bomb dominated the list of nominees, racking up 13 total.Recommended.</p>
