        <h3>by Lola Chavez</h3>
        <p>The internet creates a platform for people to share there HAHA moments. Here is a collection of moments that make me lol.</p>

        <h2><stong>Vine</stong></h2>
        <p>When I think of funny videos my mind instantly goes to Vine. Vine in my opinion is where all the original funny videos were created and what shaped a generation humor.</p>
        <p>One of my personal all time favorite vies is Beyoncé bring the beat.</p>

        <h2><em>Sometimes</em> Fresh Laughs</h2>
        <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

        <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
