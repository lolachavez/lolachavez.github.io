        <h2>Standing up for what you believe in</h2>
        <p>Rosa Parks' belief that she should not have to surrender a seat that she had paid for simply due to the color of her skin motivated her protest, along with a lifelong commitment to racial equality and justice, that has inspired thousands to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Over the last 100 years no one exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called on people to be accountable for the racial prejudices they carried. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.</p>
