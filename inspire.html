        <h2>Standing up for what you believe in</h2>
        <p>Rosa Parks' belief that she should not have to surrender a seat that she had paid for simply due to the color of her skin motivated her protest, along with a lifelong commitment to racial equality and justice, that has inspired thousands to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Even though she was a private person Rosa Parks came to be known as the "mother of the civil rights movement" for sparking demonstrations that pushed forward landmark legal efforts to end unjust segregation in the United States. Her belief in equality and her refusal to support injustice by quietly going along with unacceptable rules established Rosa Parks as an inspiration for all civil rights leaders and advocates since.</p>
